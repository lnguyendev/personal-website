                  <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
                  <p>My name is Lam Nguyen, and I currently live in Austin, Texas. I attended Purdue University where I received 
                    my Bachelor's degree in Computer Graphics Technology. I specialize in Web Development with a full-stack experience. I 
                    enjoy creating interactive and dynamic web application with beautiful user interface. I am a passionate and 
                    hard-working individual who strives to get better at what I do everyday. In my free time, I teach myself new 
                    frameworks and dev tools to keep up with current trend. I am a laid-back person, and I love being active 
                    such as playing sports and working out.

                      <p> Proficient in NetSuite's state-of-the-art ERP system and their eCommerce platform, SuiteCommerce 
                          Advanced. Employ Backbone JS framework in the front end along with other libraries like Underscore and 
                          Handlebars to write maintainable and reusable code. Utilize Sass and Bootstrap for efficient, responsive, 
                          and precise UI design. Node.js is used in the backend to interface with the NetSuite ERP system to 
                          persist and read data. Make use of Gulp.js for local development and bundling assets for deployments. 
                          Effectively work in small team to deliver custom eCommerce solution to clients leveraging the 
                          SuiteCommerce Advanced framework. Practice Agile methodology to collaboratively execute sprints in a 
                          timely, quality fashion.</p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>The Datto Project</strong><br>
                        NetSuite's eCommerce platform, SuiteCommerce Advanced, is known for building online retail stores. 
                        With the Datto project, that I got a chance to be apart of for a year, we implemented a custom solution 
                        that utilizes the brand new feature from NetSuite ERP called SuiteBilling. We created a web application that 
                        manages user's subscriptions to Datto's main services. From the application, user can choose to subscribe 
                        to any service they prefer and manage it there. Billing procedure goes through the web application and 
                        get processed in the NetSuite ERP. One of the big features that I got to work on is the promotional code 
                        system. Users can stack their promo codes by entering multiple of them, and depending on the services 
                        that they have subscribed in their cart, the promo codes would apply accordingly and provide them with 
                        discounts.

                        <strong>Launching the First SuiteSuccess Product</strong><br>
                        During my time here at Oracle | NetSuite, I had the chance to work with a team called SuiteSuccess for 
                        a short period of time. We delivered the first ever SuiteSuccess for B2B Commerce product. From the first 
                        day of customer's engagement to the day of Go-Live, it only took us 17 days to launch our client's 
                        online retail store. They had their first online transaction through the site within that first month. 
                        That was our business model, to take our client live as soon as possible, so they can save money and make 
                        money faster. A typical SuiteCommerce Advanced project would take 2 months at minimum to launch; we were 
                        able to do it 1/4 the time of that.
